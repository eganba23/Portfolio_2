## Tragectories and Variations of Family Decision Making Across Countires

In this piece, I will demonstrate my graphing abilities.

### What is Family Decision Making

As previously stated, adolescents were presented with a variety o topics that families with adolescents often have to make decisions about, and chose the answer that best reflected who made most of the decisions on each topic. The scale ranged from 1 (My parents decide this without discussing it with me) to 5 (I decide this without discussing it with my parents), with 3 representing a joint decision (My parents and I make the decision together). Adolescents were asked these questions at three timepoints, two years and three years after the initial observation.


```{r seting up FDM, echo = FALSE}

data$Country <- as.factor(data$IDN)
Country <- factor(data$Country) #country into categorical variable
data$AgeCM <- data$Age - mean(data$Age, na.rm=TRUE) #mean center age
data$FDMCM <- data$FDM - mean(data$FDM, na.rm=TRUE) #mean center FDM

#graphing FDM data > use linetype = Country to get dotted lines
data$Age_Exact <- round(data$Age, digits = 0)

#change values for males from 1 to 0: data$ChGender <- replace(data$ChGender, data$ChGender < 2, 0) 
#change values for females from 2 to 1: data$ChGender <- replace(data$ChGender, data$ChGender > 0, 1) 

```

```{r Renaming Countries, echo=FALSE}

#renaming Countries
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='1'] <- 'China-Jinan'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='2'] <- 'China-Shanghai'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='3'] <- 'Italy-Naples'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='4'] <- 'Italy-Rome'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='5'] <- 'Kenya'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='6'] <- 'Philippines'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='7'] <- 'Thailand'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='8'] <- 'Sweden'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='9'] <- 'USA-African American'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='10'] <- 'USA-European American'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='11'] <- 'USA-Hispanic'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='12'] <- 'Colombia'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='13'] <- 'Jordan'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='16'] <- 'India'
levels(data$Country)[levels(data$Country)=='17'] <- 'China-Chongqing'
data$Country <- relevel(data$Country, ref = 'USA-Hispanic')

```
### Data Being Used 

Several different variables were used for the following analyses. Alongside Family Decision Making (FDM), Age (Age), Socio-economic Status (SES), Gender (ChGender), and Country of origin (Country) were used to help identify potential trends in the data. Below are the countries utilized in this dataset.

```{r showing data}
levels(data$Country)

```

## Plotting Family Decision Making


```{r multilevel model, echo = FALSE}
#TEXT FOR IF I INCLUDE MY MODEL:   My first step was to create a multi-level model. The model below uses Family Decision Making as the outcome. The inputs were gender, country, and an interaction between age and country.

#model I used for FDM. Looking to incorporate this somehow? Not sure how.
data$Age_Exact <- round(data$Age, digits = 0)
model.FDM_outcome <- lmer(FDM ~  SES + ChGender + AgeCM + Country + AgeCM*Country + (1|ID), data = data)
```

I can begin by making a plot of Age and Family Decision Making. 

```{r base plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
ggplot(
  aes(x=Age_Exact, 
      y = FDM, 
      group = Country, 
      color = Country)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#000000","#ff0000","#8F00FF", "#0bb4ff", "#50e991", "#e6d800", "#fb19f5", "#ffa300", "#dc0ab4", "#0000fB", "#b3d4ff", "#00bfa0", "#00ffff")) +
  labs(
    x = "Age", 
    y = "Family Decision Making", 
    color = "Country",
    title = "Age and Country Effects on Family Decision Making")
```

This plot is ok, but there are majors ways to improve it. There is no rhyme or reason to the colors included, and it's hard to visualize the trend of "Family Decision Making increases as adolescents increase in age."
```{r suggestions, echo = FALSE}
#SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE
#change to geom_smooth, collapse country data (ex, all US data), change colors to represent continents, change title to better reflect data, look at doing a spaghetti plot (each person put on a graph).

#can make a faceted plot by index - allows to see changes over time by person using [ facet_wrap(~Index1) + ]

#package ggthemes <- classic color schemes that are used by several

```


My first suggestion is to smooth out the lines.
```{r smooth out, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data %>%
ggplot(
  aes(x=Age_Exact, 
      y = FDM, 
      group = Country, 
      color = Country)) + 
  geom_smooth(
    size = .5,
    span = 1,
    se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#000000","#ff0000","#8F00FF", "#0bb4ff", "#50e991", "#e6d800", "#fb19f5", "#ffa300", "#dc0ab4", "#0000fB", "#b3d4ff", "#00bfa0", "#00ffff")) +
  labs(
    x = "Age", 
    y = "Family Decision Making", 
    color = "Country",
    title = "Age and Country Effects on Family Decision Making")

```

This had the effect of minimizing the noise of the first graph. It is easier to see the overall positive linear trend of Family Decision Making as adolescents get older.

The next suggestion is to combine some of the data. For example, we can combine the United states ethnicities to create one USA line.
```{r collapse countries}

Country_Collapse <- data %>%
  mutate(Country = case_when(
    Country %in% c("USA-African American", "USA-European American", "USA-Hispanic") ~ "United States",
    Country %in% c("China-Shanghai", "China-Chongqing") ~ "China",
    Country %in% c("Italy-Naples", "Italy-Rome") ~ "Italy",
    Country == "Kenya" ~ "Kenya",
    Country == "Philippines" ~ "Philippines",
    Country == "Thailand" ~ "Thailand",
    Country == "Sweden" ~ "Sweden",
    Country == "Colombia" ~ "Colombia",
    Country == "Jordan" ~ "Jordan",
    Country == "India" ~ "India"
  ))

```



Now we can create a plot that just reflects countries.
```{r collapse countries plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Country_Collapse %>%
ggplot(
  aes(x=Age_Exact, 
      y = FDM, 
      group = Country, 
      color = Country)) + 
  geom_smooth(
    aes(group = 1),
    method = "loess",
    formula = y~x,
    se = TRUE,
    alpha = .2,
    color = "black",
    size = .5
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    size = .5,
    span = 1,
    se = FALSE
    ) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#ff0000","#8F00FF", "#0bb4ff", "#50e991", "#e6d800", "#fb19f5", "#ffa300", "#0000fB", "maroon", "#00bfa0")) +
  labs(
    x = "Age", 
    y = "Family Decision Making", 
    color = "Country",
    title = "Country Effects on Family Decision Making Over Time")

  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

#change to geom_smooth, collapse country data (ex, all US data), change colors to represent continents, change title to better reflect data, look at doing a spaghetti plot (each person put on a graph).

```

This helped clean up some of the clutter of the extra lines. I also included the average FDM line to help show the distinct differences across countries.


```{r facet by index, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Country_Collapse <- Country_Collapse %>%
  mutate(Index1 = case_when(
    Index1 == "1" ~ "Time 1",
    Index1 == "2" ~ "Time 2",
    Index1 == "3" ~ "Time 3"
  ))
view(Country_Collapse)

Country_Collapse %>% ggplot(
  aes(x=Age_Exact, 
      y = FDM, 
      group = Country, 
      color = Country)) + 
  geom_smooth(
    aes(group = 1),
    method = "loess",
    formula = y~x,
    se = TRUE,
    alpha = .2,
    color = "black",
    size = .5
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~Index1, scales = "free") +
  geom_smooth(
    size = .5,
    span = 1,
    se = FALSE
    ) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#ff0000","#8F00FF", "#0bb4ff", "#50e991", "#e6d800", "#fb19f5", "#ffa300", "#0000fB", "maroon", "#00bfa0")) +
  labs(
    x = "Age", 
    y = "Family Decision Making", 
    color = "Country",
    title = "Country Effects on Family Decision Making Over Time")

```
