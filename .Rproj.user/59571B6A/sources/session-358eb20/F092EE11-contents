```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Using dataset "Nobel", which examines information about nobel winners

There are 26 variables and 935 rows. Each row is a person (so in theory there are 934 people in the nobel dataset).

```{r get info on dataset}

glimpse(nobel)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#count(nobel) can give a table that tells me the number in each variable
#head(nobel) - gives it looking more like a table

```

### Exercise 2

Filtered out people who don't have a country, organizations that won a nobel, and people who are dead
``` {r filtered nobel}

nobel_living <- nobel %>%
 filter(country != "NA" & gender != "org" & is.na(died_date))

```


### Exercise 3

Created a dataset for American winners in physics, medicine, chemistry, and economics
``` {r Are they in the US?}
#are they in the US
nobel_living <- nobel_living %>%
  mutate(
    country_us = if_else(country == "USA", "USA", "Other")
  )

#Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics
nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Physics", "Medicine", "Chemistry", "Economics"))

```

Graph for the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize
```{r visual plot}

ggplot(
  data = nobel_living_science,
  mapping = aes(
    x = country_us,
  )
) +
  facet_wrap(~category)+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_bar()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(
      x = "Country",
      y = "Number of Prize Winners",
      title = "Relationship Between Prize Winner and Country"
  )
 
```
More USA winners in each category. Economics has a disproportionate number of USA winners. This isn't supporting much to support the buzzfeed article.


### Exercise 4

```{r born in USA?}
#adding in country born in US to the other nobel living
us_born_nobel <- nobel_living_science %>%
  mutate(
    born_country = if_else(born_country == "USA", "USA", "Other")
  )

us_born_nobel %>%
count(born_country)

```
105 people born in the USA, 123 were not.
...

### Exercise 5

Plot for born in USA winners
```{r born in USA}

ggplot(
  data = us_born_nobel,
  mapping = aes(
    x = born_country,
  )
) +
   geom_bar()+
  facet_wrap(~category)+
  theme_bw()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(
      x = "Birth Country",
      y = "Number of Prize Winners",
      title = "Relationship Between Prize Winner and Birth Country"
  )

```
Buzzfeed got it right about more nobel winners immigrating to USA. The only exception is if we're talking about economics, as econ winners mostly are US citizens in the united states.

...

### Exercise 6

```{r single pipe}

nobel_international <- nobel %>%
 filter(country == "USA" & born_country != "USA") %>%
  count(born_country) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  print()

```
UK is most common for US immigrants who won the nobel prize.
