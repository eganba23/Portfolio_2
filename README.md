# Trajectories and Variation of Family Decision Making Across Countries

Hello again!

If you have not already, go check out Portfolio_1. This is a continuation of the work in Portfolio_1, as it builds upon the skills demonstrated with additional data.

This project examines family decision making across 13 countries, exploring how to better get across "increasing in age increases family decision making across all countries. However there are slight variations in countries."

I also provided alternate versions of the plots with brief commentary on their effectiveness.
